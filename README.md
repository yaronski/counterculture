# counterculture
counterculture is a device I built with the help of many others during my time at the National Taiwan University of Technology (NTUT) in Taipei. → Digital Fabrication class by Prof. N. Tai. → 2018/19.

### concept
```
»Do you speak Chinese?«
```
```
»No, but I can count to 10 in Chinese!«
```

Being able to quantify things is essential while learning any new language → and generally quite cool, too.\
Combining visual and auditory — spoken by mother-tongue speaker — sensory feedback at the push of an arcade style button, learning to count from 0 to 10 in Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Hindi, German and Polish is now easy and fun.

### note
- I used an Arduino Mega since I had one laying around and a very limited time-frame.\
With regard to audio quality I'd recommend using a Teensy with built-in DAC instead.
- For lasercutting the box I used 5mm MDF. Takeing into account the kerf of the laser, I offset the vector path's generated from Sketchup by .19mm in Adobe Illustrator.
